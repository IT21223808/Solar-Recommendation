# Solar Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a solar recommendation system that can help users find the best solar panels for their specific needs. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's land size and other relevant factors to provide personalized recommendations. The system will also be able to predict the performance of the solar panels based on the user's location and other environmental factors. The system will be deployed on a cloud platform and can be accessed through a web interface.
